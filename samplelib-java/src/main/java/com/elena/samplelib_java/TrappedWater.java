     You need to calculate the amount of trapped water.
     You are provided with an array of integers n size that represents elevation map where width of each bar
     is 1. Compute how much water it is able to trap after raining..

     Example 1:
     Input: 3, 0, 2, 0, 4
     Output: 7
     Explanation: We can trap "3 units" of water between 3 and 2,
     "1 unit" on top of bar 2 and "3 units" between 2
     and 4.  See below diagram also.

     Example 2:
     Input: 3, 0 , 1
     Output: 1
     Explanation: We can trap "1 unit1" of water between 3 and 1.

     Example 3:
     Input: 1, 0, 0, 0, 1
     Output: 3
     Explanation: We can trap "3 unit1" of water between 1 and 1.

     Example 4:
     Input: 0, 0, 8, 0, 0
     Output: 0
     Explanation: Water is spilled from all sides
